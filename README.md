🌦️ **Weather Forecast Web App**

A clean, fast and beautifully designed weather application that gives real‑time weather updates with an intuitive and minimal user interface.

This project was built as part of Prodigy InfoTech Internship – Task 05, where the focus was on understanding APIs, UI clarity, state‑based visuals and responsive layouts.

 **Features**:
 
🌍 Search weather for any city

🌡️ Real‑time temperature, humidity & windspeed

⛅ Dynamic weather icons

📱 Fully responsive clean UI

⚡ Fast & lightweight — built with pure HTML, CSS & JavaScript

🎨 Calm color palette for a smooth user experience

**Tech Stack**:

HTML5 – Structure

CSS3 – Design & animations

JavaScript (ES6) – Logic & API handling

OpenWeatherMap API – Weather data

 How It Works: 
 
User enters a city name

JavaScript fetches data from the weather API

UI dynamically updates with live temperature, humidity, wind speed and custom weather icons

Errors (like wrong city name) are handled smoothly with alerts
